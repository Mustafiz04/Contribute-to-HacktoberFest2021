"""
You are given K eggs, and you have access to a building with N floors from 1 to N. 

Each egg is identical in function, and if an egg breaks, you cannot drop it again.

You know that there exists a floor F with 0 <= F <= N such that any egg dropped at a floor higher than F will break, and any egg dropped at or below floor F will not break.

Each move, you may take an egg (if you have an unbroken one) and drop it from any floor X (with 1 <= X <= N). 

Your goal is to know with certainty what the value of F is.
What is the minimum number of moves that you need to know with certainty what F is, regardless of the initial value of F?
